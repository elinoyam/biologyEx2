The executable file we've created was too large to upload to git, so we created a script that would create the executable file when clicked on.

In order to run the program :
First you'll need to add the "CreateExe.cmd" script to the same folder as the code file ("ex2.py") and needed files (mentioned below).
Then you just need to click on the script "CreateExe.cmd", and wait until the "ex2.exe" file will be created in the same directory.
After that you can run the program by clicking directlly on the "ex2.exe" file.


Please make sure the following files are saved in the same directory:
The encrypted file with the name "enc.txt".
The dictionary file with the name "dict.txt"
The letter frequancy file with the name "Letter_Freq.txt"
The 2 letter frequency file with the name "Letter2_Freq.txt"

The report is saved in a PDF file called "report.pdf"
